INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, etc.
---------------------------

  Normally, it should be enough to just run:

	./configure && make

  A single executable "tetris" should then have been created, which may be
  moved anywhere.  You can also run "make install" to install the program
  along with documentation and desktop integration files in /usr/local.

  If you only get error messages from the shell when you run configure, try
  to execute with "bash configure" instead.  If you don't have bash, you will
  have to edit config.mk and then run make.

  Use "./configure help" for a list of build and installation options.

  If you build with Xlib the game will pause automatically when your terminal
  window loses focus.

  By default, vitetris.xpm is installed in pixmapdir and vitetris.desktop
  in desktopdir.  If you don't want them, set those dirs to empty strings
  with configure or uncomment them in config.mk.  That is:

	./configure pixmapdir= desktopdir=

  There is a game server included which can be built with "make gameserver".
  If SAME_LEVEL_HEIGHT is defined, players will be forced to have the same
  start level and height (uncomment in src/netw/gameserver.c).
  See the README under "Network Play" for more information.

  Network functions such as socket() and gethostbyname() are sometimes not
  present in libc.  On Solaris, you need to link with libsocket and libnsl:

	bash configure LIBS="-lsocket -lnsl"

  If you want to use Allegro, you need to have the command "allegro-config"
  in your PATH.  I have only tested with version 4.2.2.


Windows
-------

  (This is for advanced users.  Most people should just download the zip file
  with binaries, extract and double-click one of the nice red icons.)

  You need MinGW and things like bash and make.  Perhaps it is easiest to use
  Cygwin and configure with:

	./configure CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" ...

  You also need to pass options to use either a curses library or Allegro.
  For example:

	./configure CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" curses=c:/pdcurs33/win32/pdcurses.a \
		CPPFLAGS=-Ic:/pdcurs33

  To use Allegro, install it in MINGDIR or C:\MinGW, and "configure" will
  find it.  Either the dynamically or the statically linked version will do.
  If both are installed, use "allegro=-lalleg_s" to get the statically linked
  version.  Example:

	./configure CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" LDFLAGS=-Wl,--subsystem,windows \
		allegro

  If you want a program icon, uncomment the following line in src/Makefile:

	#OBJS += ../icon.o


DOS
---

  If you don't have DJGPP and bash, you should get vitet055src.zip.
  Otherwise, install PDCurses and run the following.

	bash configure curses network= LIBS=-lemu
	make

  -lemu is only needed if you want it to run on really old computers without
  a floating point unit (e.g. 486SX).

  You can also use Allegro, but then your executable will be very large.  Or
  compile a version which simply prints ANSI/VT100 escape sequences like the
  original vitetris, but then you need to load ansi.sys (or nansi.sys).
